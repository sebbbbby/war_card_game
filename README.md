# Game Overview

In the game of War, two players compete by drawing cards from their respective decks. The player with the highest card wins the round and takes both cards. The game continues until one player runs out of cards, and the other player wins.

__Requirements__

Python 3.x installed on your computer.
Git / Github for version control

__Rules__

The game follows the traditional rules of War:

A standard deck of 52 cards is divided equally between two players.
In each round, both players draw one card from the top of their respective decks.
The player with the higher-ranked card wins the round and takes both cards. The ranking is as follows:
Aces (highest)
King
Queen
Jack
10
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2 (lowest)
In case of a tie (both players draw cards of the same rank), a "war" is declared. Each player places three cards face down, followed by one card face up. The player with the higher-ranked face-up card wins all the cards on the table. If there is another tie, the process repeats.
The game continues until one player runs out of cards. The player with cards remaining wins.

# Implementation
    1) Create Classes for the Game, Player, Deck and Cards
    2) Create game loop to implement START GAME
    3) Distribute Cards equally 
    4) One card per player will be revealed (printed) and compared, winner takes both function
    5) Continue and evalute cards at play till game complete
